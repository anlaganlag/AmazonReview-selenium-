  Hard to buy many things sight unseen. Not as good of quality as others I have purchased for $50 but again it was much cheaper and you get what you pay for.

  Item arrived quickly and looked exactly as shown.  It didn't fit my tablet, but that is my own fault for not measuring the tablet and just assuming the size.

  It looks fine, but hard to stand because you have to pull it's bottom side  out from the backboard.

    Perfect Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
  
Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2012Verified Purchase









  
  
    
  I spent quite a bit of time shopping for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 case that meets all of my needs. These include having multi-angle viewing capability, a thin and attractive profile, being able to charge the tablet when the case is completely closed, and a reasonable price. This case is a winner in every aspect. Beware that many cases on the market do not have an opening which will allow you to charge the tablet in the closed position. This one does which differentiates it from the competition. The case fits perfectly leaving openings for all buttons, the speakers, headphone jack, camera lenses, and charging port. The quality of the leather surface is very good as well. I also utilize all of the multiple viewing angle choices that are available depending on how I am sitting with the tablet. This is the perfect case at the right price and you won't go wrong by purchasing it!

    Item isn't well made
  
Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2013Verified Purchase









  
  
    
  The item is somewhat sleek and does have a nice feel to it, but that is about where it ends. As far as the 3 slots that your tablet set in so you can view it at an angle, they are too shallow. The smallest bump or adjustment will cause it to either slide down a row, or completely come off.  The clip the cover uses to snap onto the tablet also is off center. All in all, it's ok, but I wish I would have bought a different item.

  I like this cover, but it falls off all the time. My toddler figured out how to get it off in a matter of minutes. It has protected it against falls though. He stand is a nice feature and there's 3 different places to put it so it's always at a good angle.

  For the price this is a really nice case.... the only issue I have is the hook like closure doesnt hook (maybe it's not supposed to?). Either way, I like that it can be used as a stand and would buy this again.

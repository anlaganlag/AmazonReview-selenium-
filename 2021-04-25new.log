  I finally found the perfect case for my surface pro. With the surface pro the kickstand has only one position, which is useless for anything other than watching a movie. This case has a few different \^positions making it very useful for typing emails, reviews, watching movies, and it sits on my lap perfectly. A couple of people complained of a lack of a pen holder?? I\^m looking at the pen holder right now. I don\^t know about the surface not working with a keyboard while in the case, I only use the virtual keyboard which is perfectly fine for me. The material is very durable and protects the tablet very well. I\^m very happy with my purchase, similar cases sell for over $100, I got this for $35.

  I really like this cover, It fits nicely and the texture gives it a good grip. The magnetic cover protects the screen and auto turns off the reader. After almost a year of use, the cover split at the edge of the tab for opening the cover (where the magnet is housed). I managed to epoxy the seam to stick it back together and keep the magnet from falling out. I thought I had solved my problem, but shortly after the rubber edging started peeling off the front cover. It\^s too bad, because I really liked this cover. It\^s still useable, but doesn\^t look as nice and I\^m not sure how long it will be before the exposed seam stars splitting around the edge of the whole cover.

  It fits my Paperwhite perfectly. Opening it starts the reader and closing it stop the reader. No more worries about letting the battery drain while it times out. Instant on is much more satisfying than pressing the button for some strange reason. As a creature of convenience, I find this a completely convenient solution. And, the point of buying it of course is to also protect the screen when you stuff it into a laptop bag or equivalent. To me, this is the perfect blend of Form and Function and I could not be happier. The cherry on top is that it is not expensive at all. I can\^t even imagine how they can build such a useful tool for so little money.

  Well made highly functional!  Be aware that putting the tablet in requires reaching in afterwards with your finger and that\^s a tight squeeze so my solution is to have a piece of paper behind the tablet that extends beyond the side of the tablet.  You may then slide the "holding tab" between the tablet and paper easily and when you slide out the paper the tab will attach to the Velcro locking your tablet in. This tight design is a virtue not a negative, I don\^t want the Fire falling out and with this great design it never will! To remove the holding tab so you can remove the Fire, can  you borrow a neighbour\^s 4 year old?  Better yet I recommend  a thin plastic or metal ruler to separate the Velcro tab from the case, then pull the tab by the sides. I don\^t suggest trying to get your fat fingers in there, it\^s just too tight (for my fat digits anyhow) and you may break the Fire\^s glass.  Tablets don\^t like being bent!

  I am truly blown away at how amazing this flash light is. In the box you get the flashlight itself, a lanyard, micro USB cable, battery, and the instruction manual. The flashlight itself has 7 different modes!! moonlight is the lowest and good for getting up in the night and turning it on to see, second lowest is low which is about the same brightness as a standard small handheld flashlight, then there is medium which is more then enough light for a walk at night. then there is high which is very bright, then there is turbo which is blinding bright!! The turbo mode can shine 268 meters which is absolutely crazy. Turbo is perfect for seeing any surroundings you want to in pitch black. If you are in policing or security i highly recommend this light based on how bright and how long the radius is. The last 2 modes are strobe and SOS that use the level of brightness as turbo. As for durability, it\^s a very strong and sturdy light so i have no worries since it is rated for a 1.5 meter drop. Not to mention it\^s made of Aerospace grade Aluminum which is not only durable but light!! What\^s great about this light compared to others is it is rechargeable so you don\^t need to keep replacing batteries. There is a little flap that you open and plug in the micro USB cable. On the flash light there are 2 buttons, one to turn on the flashlight and one to cycle through the modes which is great because most other cycling flashlight use the same button. The buttons also have a light behind them that will turn red when there is 30% of power left, will flash red when there is 10% of battery left and will be green when fully charged. As for the spikes they are a bit sharp but to the point that it is safe enough to handle and you should be worry free with it in your pocket. With that being said, in an emergency self defense situation, it will do damage with force on bare skin. One other thing to love about the flashlight is it is waterproof for up to 2 meters which is amazing if you need to bring it in the rain or drop it in water. if by any chance you have a problem with the flashlight, Moko offers a 12 month warranty which gives me confidence when owning the flashlight.

Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  My Golden Retriever goes everywhere with me and loves to sit in the front seat.  2 weeks ago while driving to work (yes my dog goes to work with me too), a deer ran in front of my car and I had to slam on the brakes.  I extended my arm in front of Sandy to contain her on the seat, but she was still thrown forward and hit the dash and ended up partially on the floor.

  Our 9 year old pooch has never enjoyed wearing a collar or harness, but even she doesn\^t mind this vest. It is made of high quality, durable material and adjusts to fit snugly, yet comfortably. The universal seatbelt worked perfectly to clip her into the back seat of our SUV.

It is such a relief to find a product that she will wear without complaint. Five stars!

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  Our 9 year old pooch has never enjoyed wearing a collar or harness, but even she doesn\^t mind this vest. It is made of high quality, durable material and adjusts to fit snugly, yet comfortably. The universal seatbelt worked perfectly to clip her into the back seat of our SUV. Now, she can safely have her nose out the rolled-down window, a luxury we never afforded her before because we were afraid she would either fall or jump out. It is such a relief to find a product that she will wear without complaint. Five stars!

  I bought two of these for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies. The dogs are still too small to fit into these, but I wanted to be ready. So I haven\^t used them yet, but the build quality seems great. The best bit though, is the seatbelt attachment. I didn\^t even expect they\^d work in my car (\^09 Hyundai Tuscon), but they fit perfectly.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  My Golden Retriever goes everywhere with me and loves to sit in the front seat.  2 weeks ago while driving to work (yes my dog goes to work with me too), a deer ran in front of my car and I had to slam on the brakes.  I extended my arm in front of Sandy to contain her on the seat, but she was still thrown forward and hit the dash and ended up partially on the floor.  That really scared me...and her...I have always been terrified that she would end up going through the windshield if I get into an accident but this was the last straw....so I found this seat belt online.

  For 14.99$ you can\^t go wrong. My pup is 13lbs, and I did the measurements and a medium is a tiny bit loose on her but she\^ll grow into it. The harness itself is so easy to get on compared to some other harnesses. And the mesh makes it super comfy. The seatbelt itself is pretty much what you\^d expect. 15$ for added security while travelling is well worth it. Shipped to Ontario very quickly.

  In the box, this strap looks high quality and beautiful, but that doesn\^t last it scratches easily (as you can see from the photo). I bought this watch because it came with the adjustment tools so I can make the strap smaller. First off, the tools are flimsy. I had to get my toolbox out to hammer straight the tool after it bent on the first pin (before the first pin was even loose). Secondly, the pins are harder to remove than normal watch pins. It took more pressure than normal to pop them loose, which was problematic with flimsy tools. Third, the instructions were TERRIBLE. Literally, four grainy pictures of a different watch than the one it\^s supposed to be for. Fourth, they didn\^t  have the arrows on the band (like shown in the grainy instructions, or instructional youtube videos) so I had to google how to remove the pins and then try to figure out which end was the one to push. FYI it\^s the side that isn\^t split, but it will take some squinting to notice that.', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61ng4HVC-hL._SY88.jpg https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xttYYEb7L._SY88.jpg', '2021-04-25 13:59:54')

  Absolutely love this bracelet style band for my samsung fit 2 watch. It is so beautiful, uniqur with the colouring. And the metal is sturdy, very good quality. It even comes with a few tools to take out links for sizing. My only critique would be was when I had to remove quite a few links it was extremely difficult to pop some pins out and even ended up breaking the tool for it. However, I still got it done in the end and fits great. I can\^t wait to wear it everyday.

  True to size and looks sleek. My isssue, though, is that it doesn\^t have enough of a grip on the bottom. I bought this specifically because my dog likes to push his bowls around when we leave, so I wanted something that was going to be difficult to push with his head (he\^s a small dog), and he still manages to push it to the other side of the room. The lip on the sides is great and holds about half of the water in, so it is beneficial for cleanup but overall, the grip on the bottom is just mediocre.

  We have used these mitts for baking multiple times a week, often up to 500F and they have proven durable and high quality. The only complaint is that they are a little short for someone with long fingers. On my husband, the gloves only cover up to the bulge of the radius and ulna, and it would be nice to have these gloves protect an extra few centimetres of the wrist and lower arm while reaching into the oven to grab stuff baking at the back.

She didnt like putting her paws in the elastic legs so I cut the leg peice off (and restitched after picture taken) she wore it as a bib with less of a fuss.

  I have a Black Lab/ Border Collie mix that used to pull so much. Every time me or my wife would take her out for a walk we would end up with back or arm pain because of all the pulling she did. We tried harnesses and other collars and nothing seemed to work. Luckily we found the Pawaboo. And as soon a she used it, just like magic the pulling stopped! We couldn\^t believe it, it is great and it totally works!  Like other reviews said, our dog disliked it at the beginning but then she got used to it and now she likes it, because she associated it with her walks so she sees it as something positive.

  I was looking for a head halter product to help stop my large husky/Shepherd dog from barking so much.  I read that with other similar halters, the side pieces can ride up close to the dog\^s eyes.  I liked that this product had the side pieces to prevent this and a soft cover under the nose piece.  I slowly introduced my dog to the halter with treats (see good suggestions on the web how to do this slowly) and now she wears the halter inside the house and does not try to pull it off.  It must be comfortable enough for her to accept it and not try to pull it off, even when i am out of sight.  I continue to offer treats and good things when she is wearing this halter so she learns when it is on, it means good things will come her way.  I have noticed a reduction in the barking when she wears it but we have not had it long enough to see if the reduced barking will continue in the long term.  I attached the leash to it today and my dog seemed to accept it pretty well.  In addition the quick snap clip on the back of the head works well and the halter can be adjusted to fit the dog head properly so it can\^t be easily pulled off. It seems well made.

  My dog is a stubborn king sheppard / black lab mix and would not heel on a regular leash, and on a slip leash after training and treats still would often pull regardless of it being tight around the throat. With this leash she is now basically prancing with a slack leash and even bolted for a squirrel but came to a dead stop with next to no effort on my part! Your dog will need your patience and lots of correcting when you first put this on as my dogs initial reaction was to freak out and use her paws to get it off. After only 3-4 short walks, she "gets it". You\^ll need to teach your dog that this is OK to wear through treats and positive feedback.

  I bought this because I wanted to get away from the Samsung (Note) phones as I\^m finding Samsung getting too arrogant, especially with the non removable batteries, but I need the pen for a lot of things at work, not necessarily precision work like you might expect from a "Note" stylus but something more than a "finger".

  After over 45 years with dogs and no cats, our family decided we were ready for a cat.  We love him, but as with many cats, he does not respond when called (as opposed to the dogs coming every time!).  However, as soon as he hears this toy, even in a a sound sleep, he will come running and wanting to play (no other toy worked!).  We\^ve had it for a number of weeks now and still guaranteed that if we bring it out, he comes to us....a blessing when once we could not find him as he was sleeping/hiding in a new spot.  We were worried he slipped outside with the dogs, but once I shook the toy, he came running.  A true relief!

  This cat toy is amazing. Just as the description says; it brings out your cats natural instinct to pounce. My cat actually meows to continue playing after i stop. Another plus is that there is no wearing out of your arm; simple wrist movements is enough to engage your pet with the toy. The toy is katnip free. And who can argue with the price. The only thing is, as the disclamer says, its not safe for your pet to use unsupervised because of the thin metal wire. Not enough to subtract a star as they do disclose the danger. Although the disclamer should be a lot more visible, like on the first picture. Im going to buy another for a friend. I wouldn’t recommend for children un supervised under 11 as they may forget to put away safe after use.

  We have used these mitts for baking multiple times a week, often up to 500F and they have proven durable and high quality. The only complaint is that they are a little short for someone with long fingers. On my husband, the gloves only cover up to the bulge of the radius and ulna, and it would be nice to have these gloves protect an extra few centimetres of the wrist and lower arm while reaching into the oven to grab stuff baking at the back.

  True to size and looks sleek. My isssue, though, is that it doesn\^t have enough of a grip on the bottom. I bought this specifically because my dog likes to push his bowls around when we leave, so I wanted something that was going to be difficult to push with his head (he\^s a small dog), and he still manages to push it to the other side of the room. The lip on the sides is great and holds about half of the water in, so it is beneficial for cleanup but overall, the grip on the bottom is just mediocre.

  I got this for my kitten who has a habit of pushing his bowls around and knocking them over. It couldn\^t have been more perfect! The base is purely silicon and has a firm grip with the surface beneath. it also catches ant water or food knocked out of the bowls, so it helps keep my floor clean. It is all dishwasher safe as well, so when it gets too dirty, i can just run it through the wash with other dishes and it\^s good as new. The bowls are tiny and light, so good size for cats. I would say these bowls are too little for small dogs, though, unless they barely eat

  I got the Pawaboo Pet Carrier Backpack in size small (max 6.6 pounds). My pomeranian is 6 pounds and this size almost doesn\^t fit. I had to stuff his fur down so it wouldn\^t get caught in the zippers. I love that he is safe in here but one down side is that it is very snug which was bugging his throat.

  True to size and looks sleek. My isssue, though, is that it doesn\^t have enough of a grip on the bottom. I bought this specifically because my dog likes to push his bowls around when we leave, so I wanted something that was going to be difficult to push with his head (he\^s a small dog), and he still manages to push it to the other side of the room. The lip on the sides is great and holds about half of the water in, so it is beneficial for cleanup but overall, the grip on the bottom is just mediocre.

  I got this for my kitten who has a habit of pushing his bowls around and knocking them over. It couldn\^t have been more perfect! The base is purely silicon and has a firm grip with the surface beneath. it also catches ant water or food knocked out of the bowls, so it helps keep my floor clean. It is all dishwasher safe as well, so when it gets too dirty, i can just run it through the wash with other dishes and it\^s good as new. The bowls are tiny and light, so good size for cats.

  Our 9 year old pooch has never enjoyed wearing a collar or harness, but even she doesn\^t mind this vest. It is made of high quality, durable material and adjusts to fit snugly, yet comfortably. The universal seatbelt worked perfectly to clip her into the back seat of our SUV. Now, she can safely have her nose out the rolled-down window, a luxury we never afforded her before because we were afraid she would either fall or jump out. It is such a relief to find a product that she will wear without complaint. Five stars!

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  Very, very nice. There are 2 included, so you can more easily rationalize the price.

  I got the Pawaboo Pet Carrier Backpack in size small (max 6.6 pounds). My pomeranian is 6 pounds and this size almost doesn\^t fit. I had to stuff his fur down so it wouldn\^t get caught in the zippers. I love that he is safe in here but one down side is that it is very snug which was bugging his throat. I think I could have maybe sized up however would not want it to be loose. Can be worn on front of you or back of you in my opinion. Has zipper sides with valero.  Holes for legs, arms, and tail. He is getting older and can\^t always keep up with everyone which is why we got this. Glad I did, he is happiest when carried anyways.

  Amazing for our 5.8lbs yorkie. He fits perfectly and is very comfortable. He enjoys being carried and happy to see when we take this carrier out. He goes in and out of it with ease. Tried it on my 3.8lbs yorkie for fun and fits loosely, but still comfortable for him. So if you happen to get one that is a bit bigger than your dog, it would still be fine for them.

  This was exactly what I was looking for! Needed a backpack style carrier for my senior dog and this was the perfect purchase. He’s about 11 pounds and the large fits perfectly with a bit of breathing room. He was so happy being in the carrier he fell asleep several times! I wanted to use it for my mini  dachshund as well, but he was too long for it of course. Definitely measure your dog before purchasing.. I didn’t think my little sausage would need a large, but I’m glad I sized up!

  My dog absolutely hates this carrier... But I love it! I initially got it in the summer for bike rides, now it only comes out at family BBQ\^s for a laugh at how incredibly embarrassed he is when I strap him in. His eyes get VERY narrow and he has a horribly angry look on his face when using the carrier, but it fits well and the only thing it\^s hurting is his ego. He looks perfectly comfortable physically.

  I purchase this strap as a replacement for my Samsung Gear S3 Classic in order to change up the look. The quick release feature is nice and works well, can switch out straps in a matter of seconds. The quality of the strap is pretty good, color is nice(although more teal blue than navy blue as pictured) and the fit is fine...only reason I docked a star is due to the stiffness of the strap. I found it to be very stiff when I initially put it on and it is still quite stiff after a few days of wear. I hope it will soften up with time. I ordered a turquoise colored strap from another seller and it was much more supple at the same price point. Overall this one is ok, especially for the price.

  I got the Pawaboo Pet Carrier Backpack in size small (max 6.6 pounds). My pomeranian is 6 pounds and this size almost doesn\^t fit. I had to stuff his fur down so it wouldn\^t get caught in the zippers. I love that he is safe in here but one down side is that it is very snug which was bugging his throat. I think I could have maybe sized up however would not want it to be loose. Can be worn on front of you or back of you in my opinion. Has zipper sides with valero.  Holes for legs, arms, and tail. He is getting older and can\^t always keep up with everyone which is why we got this. Glad I did, he is happiest when carried anyways.

  This was exactly what I was looking for! Needed a backpack style carrier for my senior dog and this was the perfect purchase. He’s about 11 pounds and the large fits perfectly with a bit of breathing room. He was so happy being in the carrier he fell asleep several times! I wanted to use it for my mini  dachshund as well, but he was too long for it of course. Definitely measure your dog before purchasing.. I didn’t think my little sausage would need a large, but I’m glad I sized up!

I initially got it in the summer for bike rides, now it only comes out at family BBQ\^s for a laugh at how incredibly embarrassed he is when I strap him in.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  My Golden Retriever goes everywhere with me and loves to sit in the front seat.  2 weeks ago while driving to work (yes my dog goes to work with me too), a deer ran in front of my car and I had to slam on the brakes.

  For 14.99$ you can\^t go wrong. My pup is 13lbs, and I did the measurements and a medium is a tiny bit loose on her but she\^ll grow into it. The harness itself is so easy to get on compared to some other harnesses. And the mesh makes it super comfy. The seatbelt itself is pretty much what you\^d expect. 15$ for added security while travelling is well worth it. Shipped to Ontario very quickly.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  My Golden Retriever goes everywhere with me and loves to sit in the front seat.  2 weeks ago while driving to work (yes my dog goes to work with me too), a deer ran in front of my car and I had to slam on the brakes.  I extended my arm in front of Sandy to contain her on the seat, but she was still thrown forward and hit the dash and ended up partially on the floor.  That really scared me...and her...I have always been terrified that she would end up going through the windshield if I get into an accident but this was the last straw....so I found this seat belt online.  It is awesome!

  For 14.99$ you can\^t go wrong. My pup is 13lbs, and I did the measurements and a medium is a tiny bit loose on her but she\^ll grow into it. The harness itself is so easy to get on compared to some other harnesses. And the mesh makes it super comfy. The seatbelt itself is pretty much what you\^d expect. 15$ for added security while travelling is well worth it. Shipped to Ontario very quickly.

  Our 9 year old pooch has never enjoyed wearing a collar or harness, but even she doesn\^t mind this vest. It is made of high quality, durable material and adjusts to fit snugly, yet comfortably. The universal seatbelt worked perfectly to clip her into the back seat of our SUV. Now, she can safely have her nose out the rolled-down window, a luxury we never afforded her before because we were afraid she would either fall or jump out. It is such a relief to find a product that she will wear without complaint. Five stars!

  I bought two of these for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies. The dogs are still too small to fit into these, but I wanted to be ready.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  So far so good with this product. It doesn\^t slide and the lip around the edge is a great feature, collecting any spilled water so it doesn\^t make a mess. It\^s perfect for our eight week old morkie puppy.

  This is a quality product and very well made.  It is definitely waterproof and once your phone is in the pouch it is locked there so no bouncing while running.  The elastic belt is a little bit shorter in length than most pouches so if you prefer a running belt with extra ‘give’ this might not be the best one for you.  All in all, the price is more than reasonable for this running belt.  I recommend it!

  The quality, look, and overall construction of this lifejacket were really quite excellent. Unfortunately, there were some real problems with sizing and we had to return it.  According to the measurement chart, our dog should have been a size Medium . Given what we read in the other reviews, we ordered a size Large instead.  Even that was far too small though.  About our dog\^s shape: she is a Golden Retriever mix puppy weighing 50 lbs., Neck = 16", Chest = 25", but she\^s quite long: 26" from the base of her neck to the start of her tail.  When we tried the jacket on her, the arm holes were cutting into her underarm and shoulder to the point that she couldn\^t walk and was in real discomfort (whimpering, etc., which she doesn\^t normally do, and which she doesn\^t do in the second lifejacket we bought for her). We couldn\^t make it work no matter how much we tried adjusting.', '', '2021-04-25 14:04:28')

  True to size and looks sleek. My isssue, though, is that it doesn\^t have enough of a grip on the bottom. I bought this specifically because my dog likes to push his bowls around when we leave, so I wanted something that was going to be difficult to push with his head (he\^s a small dog), and he still manages to push it to the other side of the room. The lip on the sides is great and holds about half of the water in, so it is beneficial for cleanup but overall, the grip on the bottom is just mediocre.

  I got this for my kitten who has a habit of pushing his bowls around and knocking them over. It couldn\^t have been more perfect! The base is purely silicon and has a firm grip with the surface beneath. it also catches ant water or food knocked out of the bowls, so it helps keep my floor clean. It is all dishwasher safe as well, so when it gets too dirty, i can just run it through the wash with other dishes and it\^s good as new. The bowls are tiny and light, so good size for cats.

  Our 9 year old pooch has never enjoyed wearing a collar or harness, but even she doesn\^t mind this vest. It is made of high quality, durable material and adjusts to fit snugly, yet comfortably. The universal seatbelt worked perfectly to clip her into the back seat of our SUV. Now, she can safely have her nose out the rolled-down window, a luxury we never afforded her before because we were afraid she would either fall or jump out. It is such a relief to find a product that she will wear without complaint. Five stars!

  I bought two of these for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies. The dogs are still too small to fit into these, but I wanted to be ready. So I haven\^t used them yet, but the build quality seems great. The best bit though, is the seatbelt attachment. I didn\^t even expect they\^d work in my car (\^09 Hyundai Tuscon), but they fit perfectly.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  My Golden Retriever goes everywhere with me and loves to sit in the front seat.  2 weeks ago while driving to work (yes my dog goes to work with me too), a deer ran in front of my car and I had to slam on the brakes.  I extended my arm in front of Sandy to contain her on the seat, but she was still thrown forward and hit the dash and ended up partially on the floor.  That really scared me...and her...I have always been terrified that she would end up going through the windshield if I get into an accident but this was the last straw....so I found this seat belt online.  It is awesome!

  For 14.99$ you can\^t go wrong. My pup is 13lbs, and I did the measurements and a medium is a tiny bit loose on her but she\^ll grow into it. The harness itself is so easy to get on compared to some other harnesses. And the mesh makes it super comfy. The seatbelt itself is pretty much what you\^d expect. 15$ for added security while travelling is well worth it. Shipped to Ontario very quickly.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  Our 9 year old pooch has never enjoyed wearing a collar or harness, but even she doesn\^t mind this vest. It is made of high quality, durable material and adjusts to fit snugly, yet comfortably. The universal seatbelt worked perfectly to clip her into the back seat of our SUV. Now, she can safely have her nose out the rolled-down window, a luxury we never afforded her before because we were afraid she would either fall or jump out. It is such a relief to find a product that she will wear without complaint. Five stars!

  I bought two of these for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies. The dogs are still too small to fit into these, but I wanted to be ready. So I haven\^t used them yet, but the build quality seems great. The best bit though, is the seatbelt attachment. I didn\^t even expect they\^d work in my car (\^09 Hyundai Tuscon), but they fit perfectly. They connect correctly to all of the seat belts in the car, even the rear middle seat that has a different shape to ensure you don\^t mix them up with the belts on the side.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line. Can\^t wait to try it out in the car

  My husband is a mechanic/diesel mechanic along with a welder so he works hard, and he sweats ALOT. He was having to bring a change of shirt and hoodie to work, even during the winter because he would be soaked with sweat by lunch.

  The description seems to suggest that these covers are intended for children.  I choose this protector because I can\^t be bothered opening up a cover to get to my tablet.  I use the case with a screen protector and it works just fine for me.  All of the openings (e.g. camera, etc) align perfectly with the Fire 7 openings.  I bought one for myself (red) and one for my daughter (purple), who an adult also.  She likes her cover as much as I like mine.  She says it allows her to as clumsy as she sometimes is.  The colours are more fun than the standard black and gray.

It does look and feel like the original Garmin band, but in only a few uses after the band snapped out a couple of times already (1st time while moving some boxes around and today again while trying to put my dog\^s 30LB food bag on top of my shoulders it snapped out with the bag impact on it. Not worth trusting an expensive watch to a cheap band. Also, the screws on the back are already showing rust.

  Good seal, worked really well for me. My husband has trimmed facial hair and this mask sealed better than the one on our snorkel excursion.

  We bought these for a trip to Maui and I\^m so glad we did. The rubber is very soft so it molded easily to my face, and the snorkel has a valve so you can dive and surface without getting a mouthful of air. Great fit, easy to use. They sometimes got a bit foggy, but a little spit on the inside of the goggles fixed that. I plan to buy another set so my husband and I don\^t have to fight over this one! Great value for the money.

  Bought these a few days before our vacation for myself and my husband and they worked out great. Adjust and fit well, don\^t leak, have the air breather cover. They sometimes get a bit foggy if you are out of the water with them on, but if you rinse them and get right under the water they\^re pretty good. Would definitely recommend them for exploring on your vacay.

  This is a pretty good figit toy. It is a little bigger than I expected but it still fits in a pocket more comfortably than the cube type. There is a slot to feed a lanyard through, but it is along the seam where the top and bottom fit together and it\^s not really tightly closed there, so the strap fell off immediately.

  So far (3 or 4 weeks) so good. The material seems to be resistant but flexible to allow an easy use. It does not allow the water to enter, so it should protect the hair. I thought the ears "extension" would be enough to cover the ears and keep the water away, but it didn\^t work so well and I had to buy some ear plugs (what I\^ve always done with all the swimming caps I\^ve had).

  The cap is made of solid material and is definitely durable. However, despite the fact that I have a small head and short hair the cap barely pulled over my ears and did not keep the water out of them. What it did do was trap the water in my ears as I swam. My hair was damp when I took the cap off so it really served no purpose whatsoever. I have gone back to swimming without a cap.

  So far (3 or 4 weeks) so good. The material seems to be resistant but flexible to allow an easy use. It does not allow the water to enter, so it should protect the hair. I thought the ears "extension" would be enough to cover the ears and keep the water away, but it didn\^t work so well and I had to buy some ear plugs (what I\^ve always done with all the swimming caps I\^ve had). Good price, so if I had to, I would buy it again.

  The cap is made of solid material and is definitely durable. However, despite the fact that I have a small head and short hair the cap barely pulled over my ears and did not keep the water out of them. What it did do was trap the water in my ears as I swam. My hair was damp when I took the cap off so it really served no purpose whatsoever. I have gone back to swimming without a cap.

  It sealed water well, which gave a good protection measure for me to keep my toddler son head dry after a swimming class in the middle of the winter. As he grew, it became a little tight and I struggled to put it on him. But, with this specific color (orange) and a unique design (white spacing and big black eyes), this cap made my son visible in the pool full of kids and parents swimming, allowing me to readily track his presence.

  I ordered this for a friend and he says he loves this one and the colour (black is perfect for the colour dog he has).  The previous one we ordered was too big, this one is the perfect size.  So make sure you measure your dog\^s neck properly.  This one we got is for a medium sized dog. It has lots of holes to adjust, and the width is 1.2" which my friend thought perfect.  And it is a quality collar.  Not sure it is real leather tho?  It is very soft leather if it is leather at all.  The inside is a nice cloth and looks like it will be comfy for his dog.  You get this in a little plastic bag, there is no desc to say it is real leather.  However, I would still recommend because I think it is great quality!

  Worked amazingly, sizing was perfect. I used the halter to attached to my seatbelt holder for car rides. Unique with the loop in the front as well, makes it easy to hook on so the dog can lie down while attached in the car. Handed was great comfort for a pulling puppy learning to walk. Did rip after 8 months on the handle but ordering another one now because I found it so great and the puppy is full grown now.

The design is pretty and looks well made, but I have to return this because I need the straps on this bag, and the strap ties to the back , which makes absolutely no sense - it must be a factory error?

He’s about 11 pounds and the large fits perfectly with a bit of breathing room. He was so happy being in the carrier he fell asleep several times!

I initially got it in the summer for bike rides, now it only comes out at family BBQ\^s for a laugh at how incredibly embarrassed he is when I strap him in.

  I got the Pawaboo Pet Carrier Backpack in size small (max 6.6 pounds). My pomeranian is 6 pounds and this size almost doesn\^t fit. I had to stuff his fur down so it wouldn\^t get caught in the zippers. I love that he is safe in here but one down side is that it is very snug which was bugging his throat. I think I could have maybe sized up however would not want it to be loose. Can be worn on front of you or back of you in my opinion. Has zipper sides with valero.  Holes for legs, arms, and tail. He is getting older and can\^t always keep up with everyone which is why we got this. Glad I did, he is happiest when carried anyways.

  Hubby and I absolutely friggin love this light. Was a little surprised at how light and plastic-y it is, but to be fair, it is a simple device. We honestly didn’t expect the in built speaker which sounds very good for a tiny device, but it’s perfect for having some music from my phone. I like the modes they have for the lights but I wish it came with one that stopped at only red, that would be great. The buttons on the lamp is a little hard to use so just depend on the remote control that comes with it.

  Because I do not have a lot of makeup, this case has ample room and provides the storage I need for the quantity of makeup I have. I have never used it for travelling purposes, as I would personally find it a bit large for my own needs, but it sits on my dresser and stores my everyday makeup items wonderfully. The section for the brushes is an adequate height, and it\^s easy to clean if you get powder on them because of the plastic material. I like how you can customize the configuration of the bottom section to suit your needs. I like using the zipper compartment to store small eye shadow palettes. If you pile it with too much stuff though, it may be difficult to close. Other than that, it\^s a really great makeup case.

  I will be traveling a lot in the next 6 months so I bought this case for my makeup. I don\^t have lots, so this basically fits all of it (enough for a basic makeup set). I find it really sturdy and I love how I can organize everything how I like. It\^s not fancy looking but it appears well made and sturdy. I highly recommend it!

  This is perfect for the amount of makeup I have and organizing everything so easily. Before I just had everything in a small make up bag and had to sift through when I was looking for something, and I had things in drawers etc. Now everything can be in 1 place. I wouldn’t use it for travel - it is pretty large - unless I was travelling for more than a week or something. It’s perfect for sitting on my vanity though (and looks great too!)

  got this for Christmas and I love it. It\^s sturdy and pretty. The slots inside can be moved around to fit the space you need for your products. I can keep what I am currently using ( summer colors or fall colors) in this and store the rest elsewhere. It is sturdy enough to protect your makeup and is easy to take with or move from mirror to mirror in your home.

  My picture sucks but seriously, I love this makeup carrier. I have gone through so many cases that have failed. There is always an issue with quality or space or something. Not with this one. I love it that you can arrange it in a way that you like. It fits way more than you\^d think. I have everything I need, including a mirror in one bag. Just grab it and go. Love it... And it\^s cute too.

  My 1 year old Pyranese mix Service Dog outgrew his leather vest with raised handle, and started not wanting to "get dressed for work". I needed a good strong vest with a sturdy handle in a hurry, and that is what I got. My dog and I are extremely happy. My only disappointment is that the title of the ad is "Pawaboo Service Dog Vest", and they only included their brand\^s patches; no actual Service Dog patches. I was expecting both, based on the pic and title. Other than that, it was a great investment. I feel very safe using it in all situations now that my dog is focused on me again, and not on an uncomfortable work uniform!

  Ordered two, for two Service dogs in training.  Both are GSD, 6 months old.  One is being trained as a mental health therapy dog for anxiety, the other for a woman who is losing the use of her legs.  After two weeks of normal use, the stitching holding D ring came free on one.  Thought it was a fluke.  Next training day, when other dog did a minor tug and handle was used to pull back, whole thing came free.  These looked awesome when received.  But do not wear well.  Whatever stitching thread they use, it’s not heavy enough.  I’ll be sending them to a seamstress I know who has an industrial machine to reinforce all bindings and seams, and repair. (Would’ve sent back but missed the return window).  Very disappointed as I would’ve liked to send harnesses along with dogs, but I would NOT recommend these for use by anyone with a disability.  They just aren’t made well enough, despite the great look.  Once refurbed I’ll use cautiously for end training.

  I love this brush for the huge brush head.  I have multiple brush sets, but none of my powder brushes was even remotely as big as this brush.  The brush picks up powder nicely, applies it evenly and there are no shedding hairs.  I am not a fan of the tacky plastic handle but really, that is the least important part of a brush.  It is the quality of the brush head that matters, and this one is really good.  And really large. Good value. I recommend.

  The stylus responds well and gives a clear point that is easy to see. The one issue that is tricky to solve is that I got it for my Samsung A50 for quick doodles, and the tendency is to rest some part of my hand on the device as I draw. The phone sees it as a 2 finger pinch when this happens, so when drawing I have to float my palm consciously or else I just zoom in and out. Im sure the quick solution would be some software setting or to wear a glove. The software seems like a rabbit hole to research and the glove requires me to put that on or have it on already for quick doodling which makes it awkward.

  Our 9 year old pooch has never enjoyed wearing a collar or harness, but even she doesn\^t mind this vest. It is made of high quality, durable material and adjusts to fit snugly, yet comfortably. The universal seatbelt worked perfectly to clip her into the back seat of our SUV. Now, she can safely have her nose out the rolled-down window, a luxury we never afforded her before because we were afraid she would either fall or jump out. It is such a relief to find a product that she will wear without complaint. Five stars!

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  Our 9 year old pooch has never enjoyed wearing a collar or harness, but even she doesn\^t mind this vest. It is made of high quality, durable material and adjusts to fit snugly, yet comfortably. The universal seatbelt worked perfectly to clip her into the back seat of our SUV.

It is such a relief to find a product that she will wear without complaint. Five stars!

  I bought two of these for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies. The dogs are still too small to fit into these, but I wanted to be ready. So I haven\^t used them yet, but the build quality seems great. The best bit though, is the seatbelt attachment. I didn\^t even expect they\^d work in my car (\^09 Hyundai Tuscon), but they fit perfectly.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  My Golden Retriever goes everywhere with me and loves to sit in the front seat.  2 weeks ago while driving to work (yes my dog goes to work with me too), a deer ran in front of my car and I had to slam on the brakes.  I extended my arm in front of Sandy to contain her on the seat, but she was still thrown forward and hit the dash and ended up partially on the floor.  That really scared me...and her...I have always been terrified that she would end up going through the windshield if I get into an accident but this was the last straw....so I found this seat belt online.  It is awesome!

  For 14.99$ you can\^t go wrong. My pup is 13lbs, and I did the measurements and a medium is a tiny bit loose on her but she\^ll grow into it. The harness itself is so easy to get on compared to some other harnesses. And the mesh makes it super comfy. The seatbelt itself is pretty much what you\^d expect. 15$ for added security while travelling is well worth it. Shipped to Ontario very quickly.

  It’s ok. It does what it’s meant, during the day we use it so baby’s pacifier doesn’t fall into the couch or under and other smaller spaces. We wanted this to work at night but if your baby turns a lot like ours, it may not work. It often got stuck under my sons face/chest as he would turn his head with the paci in his mouth and he would wake up from it

  I love this thing so much! My 10 month old was waking me at night bc he would lose his pacifier and I’d have to go in and find it for him. Since we got the elephant stuffed animal to connect to his pacifier he never wakes me up anymore!!! I love that it can be used with any style pacifier and that you can throw it in the washer machine. Yay for sleeping through the night!

  I had bought 4 wubbanubs - and although I do love them, and I think they are genius this product is WAY better and cheaper - you can actually wash the stuffy separately and attach any pacifier to it and change it as your baby grows and needs a different kind . Plus the stuffy is big enough for baby to hug it and have it as a small comfort toy. I love this product and would highly recommend it !

  I purchased the elephant first. My baby loves it. I noticed that it cleans her tongue too. So i bought another one (dog) I returned it as the pacifier is different. I ordered the giraffe which has the same pacifier as the elephant. The toys are light and right size for babies. I like how you can remove it to wash the toys and sterilize the pacifier. Highly recommended. They are great with the return as well, received my refund as sooner than I expected.

  We ordered the elephant and it is super soft and great quality. I especially love that you can attach whatever soother your baby is using, so you can stick with baby’s favourite soother! The stuffy is not heavy but still works to keep the soother close to the mouth when it is spit out!

  Great product. Looks good and fits well with the Apple design, well built, and very stable with pads to keep the iPad and the stand in place. Highly recommend. My one complaint would be that quick taps on the iPad does cause the stand to slightly bounce but I\^m not sure you could solve that without making the stand a lot thicker. I\^ve learned to just make more solid taps on the iPad which will prevent the iPad from shaking.

  My 3 month old constantly would chomp on his hands till they were pretty much raw. I ended up getting one of these mitts because he wouldn’t grasp teething toys yet and this just made sense. He absolutely loves it! I take this mitt literally everywhere I go. Much cheaper than the actual ‘munch mitt’ and does the job just fine. A couple of down sides that I will mention, it does take a bit for them to figure out how to put the tip in their mouth since the tip is quite large. It’s fairly easy to clean by just wiping the surface but it does stain over time. It would be better if these came in pairs once they’re in full blown teething. That being said I would 100% recomened this product still.

  Bought these, along with a durable quality made, full length wide harness. My small doggo, a Pomeranian/Papillon cross always either rides up front in the middle in the truck or passenger/back seat in the car. When you’re driving and something causes you to have to brake hard, you would have to make sure to grab and hold onto him, but what about the time you can’t do that or what happens if you get into an accident. No matter how strong you are, in an accident, it’s just a simple matter of physics that you won’t be able to stop him. So I bought these. One for each vehicle and now I know confidently that my little furry buddy will be just as safe as I or my wife. They are adjustable and easy to use and the clip fits into the buckle, very firm and very secure. I have one in my 2011 Dodge Ram and the other in my wife’s 2015 Jetta, and the clip fastens into either buckle no problem. If you have a small dog, I can’t recommend these belts enough. Buy them now. It’s a very smart investment, any one with a small dog should make. Be proactive. You expect all your loved ones to buckle up and be safe in any vehicle. Make sure that includes your pupper. Don’t hesitate because by then it could be too late!

  I purchased this product to keep my dog from moving around in the car (he loves running back and forth between windows). First time using it, he tried to do this and the buckle bent inside the seat belt clip. As the buckle was stuck inside the seat belt clip, the seat of the car was completely useless until the actual seat belt mechanism was removed and taken apart to remove this buckle. Would not recommend if you have a strong dog.

  I love this brush for the huge brush head.  I have multiple brush sets, but none of my powder brushes was even remotely as big as this brush.  The brush picks up powder nicely, applies it evenly and there are no shedding hairs.  I am not a fan of the tacky plastic handle but really, that is the least important part of a brush.  It is the quality of the brush head that matters, and this one is really good.  And really large. Good value. I recommend.

I really am so pleased with this brushe\^s size,quality, ease of use and performance. I bought it because my old kabuki brush is coming apart and I needed a good brush to apply mineral powder foundation. This is one of the best brushes I own and I own a lot. It\^s even better than some of my high end powder brushes

  I love this lunch bag. Spacious enough and easy to carry. I gave it 4 stars because it came with a weird factory smell that I can’t seem to get rid of. I put it in the washer and it still smells like chemicals. I’ve been using the bag for over a week now and the smell is slowly fading away.

  I purchased this lunch bag after changing jobs and having to commute via public transit.  The lunch bag serves this purpose perfectly - the strap makes it very easy to commute with and leaves you hands-free.  on top of that, the lunch bag holds a good capacity (i.e. large Tupperware as well as a small Tupperware and still have room for loose items (i.e. fruit, etc.).  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this product!

  I love this lunch bag. Spacious enough and easy to carry. I gave it 4 stars because it came with a weird factory smell that I can’t seem to get rid of. I put it in the washer and it still smells like chemicals. I’ve been using the bag for over a week now and the smell is slowly fading away.

  I purchased this lunch bag after changing jobs and having to commute via public transit.  The lunch bag serves this purpose perfectly - the strap makes it very easy to commute with and leaves you hands-free.  on top of that, the lunch bag holds a good capacity (i.e. large Tupperware as well as a small Tupperware and still have room for loose items (i.e. fruit, etc.).  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this product!

  I cannot believe how well this actually worked!! I can use it while he’s asleep or awake and it doesn’t bother him at all. There has been no irritation to his skin. He finds it ticklish on his toes! The only drawback is when his nails grown in they’re quite sharp. So I end up using this every other day if not daily on a nail or two. Still totally worth it though!

  Worked amazingly, sizing was perfect. I used the halter to attached to my seatbelt holder for car rides. Unique with the loop in the front as well, makes it easy to hook on so the dog can lie down while attached in the car. Handed was great comfort for a pulling puppy learning to walk. Did rip after 8 months on the handle but ordering another one now because I found it so great and the puppy is full grown now.

  I love this brush for the huge brush head.  I have multiple brush sets, but none of my powder brushes was even remotely as big as this brush.  The brush picks up powder nicely, applies it evenly and there are no shedding hairs.  I am not a fan of the tacky plastic handle but really, that is the least important part of a brush.  It is the quality of the brush head that matters, and this one is really good.  And really large. Good value. I recommend.

  I have to say I expected this brush to be good depending on the few good reviews that I read here on Amazon, but It exceeded my expectations. I really am so pleased with this brushe\^s size,quality, ease of use and performance. I bought it because my old kabuki brush is coming apart and I needed a good brush to apply mineral powder foundation. This is one of the best brushes I own and I own a lot. It\^s even better than some of my high end powder brushes

  I really like this dress. I’m not all an CD to a small, butnordered the medium as recommended by others to size up one size plus there were no small available. The medium is slightly to big but I can live with it, because it’s so pretty. I don’t have an issue with it being see through at all and the built in slip is soft, comfortable and long enough to cover what should be covered. The straps are adjustable which is great because I needed to adjust mine smaller, and the hidden zipper works perfectly and does not catch the material. I would buy this in certain other patters/colours, the price is reasonable. I also love the racer back and way it gets longer in the back. Nice dress for sure and I do recommend it!

  I really like this dress. I’m not all an CD to a small, butnordered the medium as recommended by others to size up one size plus there were no small available. The medium is slightly to big but I can live with it, because it’s so pretty. I don’t have an issue with it being see through at all and the built in slip is soft, comfortable and long enough to cover what should be covered. The straps are adjustable which is great because I needed to adjust mine smaller, and the hidden zipper works perfectly and does not catch the material. I would buy this in certain other patters/colours, the price is reasonable. I also love the racer back and way it gets longer in the back. Nice dress for sure and I do recommend it!

  My 1 year old Pyranese mix Service Dog outgrew his leather vest with raised handle, and started not wanting to "get dressed for work". I needed a good strong vest with a sturdy handle in a hurry, and that is what I got. My dog and I are extremely happy.

I was expecting both, based on the pic and title. Other than that, it was a great investment.

  Ordered two, for two Service dogs in training.  Both are GSD, 6 months old.  One is being trained as a mental health therapy dog for anxiety, the other for a woman who is losing the use of her legs.  After two weeks of normal use, the stitching holding D ring came free on one.  Thought it was a fluke.  Next training day, when other dog did a minor tug and handle was used to pull back, whole thing came free.  These looked awesome when received.  But do not wear well.  Whatever stitching thread they use, it’s not heavy enough.  I’ll be sending them to a seamstress I know who has an industrial machine to reinforce all bindings and seams, and repair. (Would’ve sent back but missed the return window).  Very disappointed as I would’ve liked to send harnesses along with dogs, but I would NOT recommend these for use by anyone with a disability.  They just aren’t made well enough, despite the great look.  Once refurbed I’ll use cautiously for end training.

  The quality, look, and overall construction of this lifejacket were really quite excellent. Unfortunately, there were some real problems with sizing and we had to return it.  According to the measurement chart, our dog should have been a size Medium . Given what we read in the other reviews, we ordered a size Large instead.  Even that was far too small though.  About our dog\^s shape: she is a Golden Retriever mix puppy weighing 50 lbs., Neck = 16", Chest = 25", but she\^s quite long: 26" from the base of her neck to the start of her tail.  When we tried the jacket on her, the arm holes were cutting into her underarm and shoulder to the point that she couldn\^t walk and was in real discomfort (whimpering, etc., which she doesn\^t normally do, and which she doesn\^t do in the second lifejacket we bought for her). We couldn\^t make it work no matter how much we tried adjusting.', '', '2021-04-25 14:13:19')

  Very disappointed that this product is NOT compatible with a Smart Keyboard!!! I have an IPad Air, Gen 3 and the Apple Smart Keyboard that I bought with it and this case does not have a large enough opening along the side for the keyboard to attach.  I am extremely disappointed and would not recommend this product.  Additionally, I’m not even sure this case fits an IPad securely.  Similar to a cheap phone case, it seems like the Ipad case is barely holding on to your iPad and so I get the sense that a small bump could bump the IPad right out of the case.  Overall, not a good product.

  It’s ok. It does what it’s meant, during the day we use it so baby’s pacifier doesn’t fall into the couch or under and other smaller spaces.

  I had bought 4 wubbanubs - and although I do love them, and I think they are genius this product is WAY better and cheaper - you can actually wash the stuffy separately and attach any pacifier to it and change it as your baby grows and needs a different kind . Plus the stuffy is big enough for baby to hug it and have it as a small comfort toy. I love this product and would highly recommend it !

  I purchased the elephant first. My baby loves it. I noticed that it cleans her tongue too. So i bought another one (dog) I returned it as the pacifier is different. I ordered the giraffe which has the same pacifier as the elephant. The toys are light and right size for babies. I like how you can remove it to wash the toys and sterilize the pacifier. Highly recommended. They are great with the return as well, received my refund as sooner than I expected.

  I looked for a sizing chart. I figured amazon Canada would post Canadian sizes, unless otherwise specified. I was excited by the price. When i got it, i gave the top a go, though i was not too optimistic. I felt like an elephant being stuffed in a chevy volt. Maybe it was not quite that bad, but this xxl was about a Canadian L. Quality is alright. Not great but not terrible material. Stiching is surprisingly good, not sure of thread quality - did not rip during the hilarious try-on process. Cup size is around small c or generous b... which made the whole thing even funnier. Giving it a lower than average review because of the sizing and inconvenience of having to return item. Please add an accurate sizing chart, roxzoom, or provide measurements in product dimension!!!

  I am giving 5 star review since I haven’t had it very long but to that point it appears to be sturdy enough, my heavier kitten (he feels like a cat “solid” weight ) jumps in through the peek hole or just anywhere if he thinks his sister is inside, they chase through it over and over & haul it across the room even flip it upside down, there’s a couple toys in the peek hole so yeah we like it , if you buy the bigger size you need plenty of space

  My cat comes running when he hears me opening his tunnel! The frame is sturdy (the cat doesn\^t always stick to the inside of the tunnel...); however, the material does show some signs of nail and bite marks from use, but for the use, I am getting out of this, I\^d happily buy down the road! Great for cat naps and defusing cat zoomies!

  I had bought 4 wubbanubs - and although I do love them, and I think they are genius this product is WAY better and cheaper - you can actually wash the stuffy separately and attach any pacifier to it and change it as your baby grows and needs a different kind . Plus the stuffy is big enough for baby to hug it and have it as a small comfort toy. I love this product and would highly recommend it !

  I purchased the elephant first. My baby loves it. I noticed that it cleans her tongue too. So i bought another one (dog) I returned it as the pacifier is different. I ordered the giraffe which has the same pacifier as the elephant. The toys are light and right size for babies. I like how you can remove it to wash the toys and sterilize the pacifier. Highly recommended. They are great with the return as well, received my refund as sooner than I expected.

  We ordered the elephant and it is super soft and great quality. I especially love that you can attach whatever soother your baby is using, so you can stick with baby’s favourite soother! The stuffy is not heavy but still works to keep the soother close to the mouth when it is spit out!

  Bought for wet bathing suits after the pool. The bags are cute, strong and waterproof. Love having the option of the 2 zippers. Description of the product was very accurate, photo taken on (and beside) standard size placemat for those that dont want to actually leave their spot on the couch to look at a ruler/tape measure!

The lunch bag serves this purpose perfectly - the strap makes it very easy to commute with and leaves you hands-free.  on top of that, the lunch bag holds a good capacity (i.e. large Tupperware as well as a small Tupperware and still have room for loose items (i.e. fruit, etc.).

  I really like this bag.  Working in Healthcare I need to bring lots of stuff up for my shift, I prepare a tea in a thermos, large water bottle, and lunch.  The pocket is nice for extra stuff like a charging cord and other accessories while I\^m coming from the locker room. I love the shoulder strap and how the bottom is sewn to sit flat!  Washed it right away as it came with a plastic smell.

  I love this lunch bag. Spacious enough and easy to carry. I gave it 4 stars because it came with a weird factory smell that I can’t seem to get rid of. I put it in the washer and it still smells like chemicals. I’ve been using the bag for over a week now and the smell is slowly fading away.

  I purchased this lunch bag after changing jobs and having to commute via public transit.  The lunch bag serves this purpose perfectly - the strap makes it very easy to commute with and leaves you hands-free.  on top of that, the lunch bag holds a good capacity (i.e. large Tupperware as well as a small Tupperware and still have room for loose items (i.e. fruit, etc.).  Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this product!

  Waste of money. Ordered a large for my boxer and it barely fits my cocker spaniel. It’s not made properly to even fit. It’s flat so it hangs flat over the dogs face and does not have any shape that a hat should have. Not contoured and made from a floppy material so you can’t even shape it or the bill to sit properly. May as well have cut a couple holes in an old sock and put it on her head cause that’s about all the good this will do. Terrible measurement descriptions, and poorly made product.

  My daughter had a great time making this.  On issue is that the wind handle, instead of being on the bottom of the unit faces upwards.  This forces you to have to twist the carousel to wind, which due to the force needed is very difficult to not separate or collapse the dome, especially for a young child.  If the crank was at the bottom it would have made a huge difference.

  Overall I’m pleased with this product. The cloths are quite absorbent and contain spit up and drool well. Cute prints too! I removed one star as they seem a tad smaller than the stated measurements and the packaging they came in was minimalist to the extreme. They were shipped in a plastic bag with no product label or care tags or any store information whatsoever which I found a bit odd. I recommended machine washing and tumble drying on low for maintenance. Still a good product though. I would repurchase.

  Loving this case! Fits like a glove, with a nice, high quality non-slip rubber/silicone feel. The camera bump is well covered by the thickness of the case which is one of my main pet peeves of other cases. However, this case isn\^t thick at all, as it strikes the perfect balance between feeling thick enough to absorb shocks from dropping accidentally onto a counter or a few feet, but still thin enough to slip into the pocket. There is a slightly textured surface on the back which helps a lot with grip, and it doesn\^t take on dust/fingerprints so it stays looking amazing. The buttons are fully enclosed which helps keep dust out. If there was one thing I could add to this awesome case, it would be flaps that cover the headphone/USB micro jack at the bottom which would make this thing a fully waterproof beast!

  Because I do not have a lot of makeup, this case has ample room and provides the storage I need for the quantity of makeup I have. I have never used it for travelling purposes, as I would personally find it a bit large for my own needs, but it sits on my dresser and stores my everyday makeup items wonderfully. The section for the brushes is an adequate height, and it\^s easy to clean if you get powder on them because of the plastic material. I like how you can customize the configuration of the bottom section to suit your needs. I like using the zipper compartment to store small eye shadow palettes. If you pile it with too much stuff though, it may be difficult to close. Other than that, it\^s a really great makeup case.

  Great product - design is like apples own case. The only thing is that because it has a clear plastic back and it curves around the corners to secure its hold, it feels a little sharp when you hold it from the bottom on your palms. Love the design(fish/waves).  Great price. Paired with tech armour ballistic screen protector.

  Love that the pacifier is removable. Using this to help my little one give up her pacifier. Out unicorn has come into contact with blueberry fingers and all kinds of messy hands, and it is wonderful it can just be thrown in the wash, cover it with stain remover first but has always come out looking almost brand new, I do have trouble getting stains out of the part that actually holds the pacifier so it looks a little more worn after dealing with a toddler for a few months but I just bought a second one because my little one loves her “pinky” so much!

  My 9 month old LOVES this elephant! It’s the perfect size for her little hands, provides her with the ability to self sooth at night to sleep by not losing her pacifier in her bed.

  It’s ok. It does what it’s meant, during the day we use it so baby’s pacifier doesn’t fall into the couch or under and other smaller spaces. We wanted this to work at night but if your baby turns a lot like ours, it may not work. It often got stuck under my sons face/chest as he would turn his head with the paci in his mouth and he would wake up from it

  I had bought 4 wubbanubs - and although I do love them, and I think they are genius this product is WAY better and cheaper - you can actually wash the stuffy separately and attach any pacifier to it and change it as your baby grows and needs a different kind . Plus the stuffy is big enough for baby to hug it and have it as a small comfort toy. I love this product and would highly recommend it !

  I purchased the elephant first. My baby loves it. I noticed that it cleans her tongue too. So i bought another one (dog) I returned it as the pacifier is different. I ordered the giraffe which has the same pacifier as the elephant. The toys are light and right size for babies. I like how you can remove it to wash the toys and sterilize the pacifier. Highly recommended. They are great with the return as well, received my refund as sooner than I expected.

  Love this little crossbody. It was great for travel, I wanted one for the airport to keep my passport/tickets. I love that it has two sides. The only drawback is that if you put too many things in the pockets you won’t be able to stick the Velcro patches together, since they are small and need to be lined up. Overall this bag is convenient and had more space than I thought it would. Worth the price for sure.

  I love the colour of this mat. I got the lavender, and it\^s a perfect grey/purple colour. The back is a nice camel grey colour. It came very tightly rolled and pretty much frozen solid (that\^s the winter\^s fault.) It does take some effort to get this to unfurl- I unrolled it and weighed it down with some old textbooks while it thawed, and that seemed to help, but the ends were still curling heavily. I hit it with a hair dryer and then turned it over and weighed it down again and that improved it too. Finally I hit it with a heat gun (be careful not to melt it!) and weighed it down again and we\^re 90% of the way there. I might have to do another round of heat and weight. But it\^s the perfect compliment to my office and a nice thickness and I think I\^ll really enjoy having this protecting my desk surface.

  Size is great. It holds my keyboard, mouse, mounted phone, drinks and still has more space. The material is a little different than I thought it would be but is VERY easy to wipe. The Navy side is a bit stiffer than the yellow, where the yellow is a bit softer  to the touch. The downside is that the dark mat shows dust, debris, and cat hair quickly but the upside is that it is super easy to clean. I\^ve had it for a month and it\^s still curled a bit at the edges, as in not laying flat from being packaged in a tube but I think I good steam or soak in hot water (totally water proof) will do the trick.

  I love that the material is the same on both sides. Some mats have a different softer coating to prevent sliding and this, with time, will come off. This one doesn\^t have that coating. It may slide on your desk, but for me this is not happening. I love how large it is. It\^s very easy to clean. It comes rolled so you\^ll need to give it time to flatten.

  I bought this mat to protect my new desk, work as a writing pad and mouse pad.  It comes in 2 colours which is great.  Nice durable material and flattens out with some weights on the corners pretty quickly and does not roll up.

  I love the colour of this mat. I got the lavender, and it\^s a perfect grey/purple colour. The back is a nice camel grey colour. It came very tightly rolled and pretty much frozen solid (that\^s the winter\^s fault.) It does take some effort to get this to unfurl- I unrolled it and weighed it down with some old textbooks while it thawed, and that seemed to help, but the ends were still curling heavily. I hit it with a hair dryer and then turned it over and weighed it down again and that improved it too. Finally I hit it with a heat gun (be careful not to melt it!) and weighed it down again and we\^re 90% of the way there. I might have to do another round of heat and weight. But it\^s the perfect compliment to my office and a nice thickness and I think I\^ll really enjoy having this protecting my desk surface.

  Absolutely perfect. I love the design, the pink and the light grey/silver sides are both beautiful. I bought this to protect my wooden desk. I\^m a really clumsy person so I need a waterproof desk mat like this. Also, my kitties adore to sleep on it while I (try to) work. :)

  Size is great. It holds my keyboard, mouse, mounted phone, drinks and still has more space. The material is a little different than I thought it would be but is VERY easy to wipe. The Navy side is a bit stiffer than the yellow, where the yellow is a bit softer  to the touch. The downside is that the dark mat shows dust, debris, and cat hair quickly but the upside is that it is super easy to clean. I\^ve had it for a month and it\^s still curled a bit at the edges, as in not laying flat from being packaged in a tube but I think I good steam or soak in hot water (totally water proof) will do the trick.

  I love that the material is the same on both sides. Some mats have a different softer coating to prevent sliding and this, with time, will come off. This one doesn\^t have that coating. It may slide on your desk, but for me this is not happening. I love how large it is. It\^s very easy to clean. It comes rolled so you\^ll need to give it time to flatten. I suggest putting books on it for a few days.

  I got the Pawaboo Pet Carrier Backpack in size small (max 6.6 pounds). My pomeranian is 6 pounds and this size almost doesn\^t fit. I had to stuff his fur down so it wouldn\^t get caught in the zippers. I love that he is safe in here but one down side is that it is very snug which was bugging his throat. I think I could have maybe sized up however would not want it to be loose. Can be worn on front of you or back of you in my opinion. Has zipper sides with valero.  Holes for legs, arms, and tail. He is getting older and can\^t always keep up with everyone which is why we got this. Glad I did, he is happiest when carried anyways.

  This was exactly what I was looking for! Needed a backpack style carrier for my senior dog and this was the perfect purchase. He’s about 11 pounds and the large fits perfectly with a bit of breathing room. He was so happy being in the carrier he fell asleep several times! I wanted to use it for my mini  dachshund as well, but he was too long for it of course. Definitely measure your dog before purchasing.. I didn’t think my little sausage would need a large, but I’m glad I sized up!

  The coat is the right size and the colors are as presented.  I have a long torso and long arms, so I was worried that it would be a tad too short, but it fits like a glove! Perhaps it would feel long on shorter people, but the elastic wrist cuffs makes it fitting for all sizes.

  I bought this for my dog who hates showers. 10/10 it definitely captures his attention for the duration of the shower/bath, but the struggle to wash out the peanut butter after is horrendous. If you want to use peanut butter, I recommend you put this into the dishwasher to clean. The dishwasher seems to be the only method that works to clean this. Otherwise, this is a pretty good purchase!

  Purchased a set of 3 bands. The colours were the same as in the pictures and fits the Charge HR3 well. The strap is long enough to fit a large wrist. I have a very small wrist so the strap wraps around quite a bit. While this is not an issue as it has 2 loops to hold the excess strap in place, unfortunately, the 2nd loop does not stay in place and I frequently have to slide the strap back into the loop. The issue could easily be resolved if the loop had a tab to hold it in place on the strap (the strap is perforated).

  I purchased a Kindle Paper White  for my Wife for Christmas, Amazon description was not clear, ie I assumed that it was a 2019 model and ordered a MoKo  case as a separate order. It was not until he Kindle arrived that I realized that it was a 2018 edition. I had to return the case and re-order. The description of the MoKo case clearly states that it will not fit the 2018 edition.

  I had purchased a Moko case for my husband\^s tablet two years ago and he loves the quality and functionality.  However, the design and quality of this new design does not match up with the previous generation.  My biggest issue is with the way the tablet is propped up for angle viewing: the front cover flips backward and must be fitted into a slot, leaving the tablet to rest on a 2 or 3" inch area that has a fold running down the centre. I would suggest finding a case that props the tablet with a simple forward flip so that the tablet is resting on the entire flat area of the front cover (this is the design of my husband\^s 2 year old Moko) - this is what I did and am very happy with my decision.

  For 14.99$ you can\^t go wrong. My pup is 13lbs, and I did the measurements and a medium is a tiny bit loose on her but she\^ll grow into it. The harness itself is so easy to get on compared to some other harnesses. And the mesh makes it super comfy.

  Im a regular amazon shopper to give some perspective when i say i absolutley loved the pillow cases and would definitely reccomend as well as buy again in the future.

  I love everything about these pillow covers! They are exactly as claimed in the advertising! Very nicely made with nice invisible zippers. They have been professionally sewn with obvious care As I am a seamstress myself, but just didn\^t have the time to travel to get supplies, it was very convenient just to order them. The only thing I can see that wasn\^t done was matching the checks with the reverse side but for the money I wasn\^t expecting that to happen. I have some down pillow inserts that I bought that I now just buy pillow covers for. I don\^t have a lot of space to store decorator pillows with no zippers!

  The quality is super nice. I\^m impressed by the zipper concealment and the texture. I wanted a yellow burnt kind of orange and maybe was a bit optimistic by the tone in the photos. I did my best to hold the photos up to my wall palette and area rug, sadly these are more of a red tone. Hex color #f2382e is as close as I can pick on my phone.

  Just as advertised. Great linen texture. Feels built-to-last. The zipper is well hidden. I got the grey set. They\^re coloured just like the picture. I stuffed them with a larger, older pillow\^s fluff so I can\^t speak for what size insert to order.

Furthermore, they are not a matte colour as I expected; they are a little shiny, which I didn’t like. For me, this renders the product itself 4/5 stars, as while they appear to be durable and they do indeed feel nice, they aren\^t what I expected based on the photos.', '', '2021-04-25 14:25:12'), ('R3KU5OD81KWR0M','CA', 'B07K176GH3', 'Danielle ', '5.0', 'Incredible Value','Reviewed in Canada on March 31, 2019','29', '
  I\^m redecorating my living room and have a deep love for throw pillows. I went to H&M, Winner\^s, and all the other big boiz to find some cushion covers. Yet, there I stood, with a single cushion cover in hand for a staggering $39.99, though right next to me was a completed cushion for 24.99. Why was I about to pay more for just a sad, empty shell (much like myself)? The craftsmaship was shoddy for the price, so I decided to test out \^ol faithful (Amazon). Enter these 2 velvety baddies. 2 for approximately $9 a pop! Soft as hell, fit my inserts perfectly, and overall just solid as hell. My living room is now one step closer to being a velvet draped doom cave.

  Our 9 year old pooch has never enjoyed wearing a collar or harness, but even she doesn\^t mind this vest. It is made of high quality, durable material and adjusts to fit snugly, yet comfortably. The universal seatbelt worked perfectly to clip her into the back seat of our SUV. Now, she can safely have her nose out the rolled-down window, a luxury we never afforded her before because we were afraid she would either fall or jump out. It is such a relief to find a product that she will wear without complaint. Five stars!

  I bought two of these for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppies. The dogs are still too small to fit into these, but I wanted to be ready.

I didn\^t even expect they\^d work in my car (\^09 Hyundai Tuscon), but they fit perfectly.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all. Since he is only a puppy tho I may have to size him up in a few months he is currently in a small which fits very well we have a little bit of extra room in both straps for him to grow some, but we will see of this will be his forever harness or if we will need a bigger size down the line.

  We just received this yesterday so we haven\^t used it in the car yet but so far I love the harness, and don\^t see why I wont love it in the car, we had a step in harness before and this one I feel is a lot more comfortable for my pup, when he pulls on his leash, which would be similar to what would happen if something happened while driving, he gets pulled back and the straps don\^t seem to dig in like his other harness another perk is unlike his other harness which it didn\^t matter how tight I had it he could chew on it this one fits a lot better and is fitted in a way that he can\^t chew it at all.

  I love the feel of these cushion covers―they are soft, velvety, and appear to be durable.

  I\^m redecorating my living room and have a deep love for throw pillows. I went to H&M, Winner\^s, and all the other big boiz to find some cushion covers. Yet, there I stood, with a single cushion cover in hand for a staggering $39.99, though right next to me was a completed cushion for 24.99. Why was I about to pay more for just a sad, empty shell (much like myself)? The craftsmaship was shoddy for the price, so I decided to test out \^ol faithful (Amazon). Enter these 2 velvety baddies. 2 for approximately $9 a pop! Soft as hell, fit my inserts perfectly, and overall just solid as hell. My living room is now one step closer to being a velvet draped doom cave.

Furthermore, they are not a matte colour as I expected; they are a little shiny, which I didn’t like. For me, this renders the product itself 4/5 stars, as while they appear to be durable and they do indeed feel nice, they aren\^t what I expected based on the photos.', '', '2021-04-25 14:25:16'), ('R3KU5OD81KWR0M','CA', 'B07K1VLJST', 'Danielle ', '5.0', 'Incredible Value','Reviewed in Canada on March 31, 2019','29', '
  I\^m redecorating my living room and have a deep love for throw pillows. I went to H&M, Winner\^s, and all the other big boiz to find some cushion covers. Yet, there I stood, with a single cushion cover in hand for a staggering $39.99, though right next to me was a completed cushion for 24.99. Why was I about to pay more for just a sad, empty shell (much like myself)? The craftsmaship was shoddy for the price, so I decided to test out \^ol faithful (Amazon). Enter these 2 velvety baddies. 2 for approximately $9 a pop! Soft as hell, fit my inserts perfectly, and overall just solid as hell. My living room is now one step closer to being a velvet draped doom cave.

  Pillow cases are exactly as pictured, colour as expected, nice and soft and look really nice...only issue is that the zipper is in an awkward spot going across one of the faces of the pillow rather than being built into the seam. So there is a definite "front" and "back" to these cases. This is shown in the pics, which I obviously missed, but regardless  they are still very nice looking, and appear to be of good quality.

  Pillow cases are exactly as pictured, colour as expected, nice and soft and look really nice...only issue is that the zipper is in an awkward spot going across one of the faces of the pillow rather than being built into the seam. So there is a definite "front" and "back" to these cases. This is shown in the pics, which I obviously missed, but regardless  they are still very nice looking, and appear to be of good quality. Would definitely recommend, just wanted to caution about the placement of the zipper.

  I love everything about these pillow covers! They are exactly as claimed in the advertising! Very nicely made with nice invisible zippers. They have been professionally sewn with obvious care As I am a seamstress myself, but just didn\^t have the time to travel to get supplies, it was very convenient just to order them. The only thing I can see that wasn\^t done was matching the checks with the reverse side but for the money I wasn\^t expecting that to happen.

  The quality is super nice. I\^m impressed by the zipper concealment and the texture. I wanted a yellow burnt kind of orange and maybe was a bit optimistic by the tone in the photos.

  This is great for the car, although the bottom goes below my sons feet so it can’t really be used as a table for his lap. The iPad pocket stretches out very fast but it’s still functional. The best thing it does it stop things my kid drops from going straight to the floor. Instead the bottom of this catches it and it’s easier for the driver to reach. It also catches food or crumbs.

  we bought this one for a long trip by car, was helpful but there is an issue that bothered us and was that is not easy to close the table side with the full zipper when is still attached to the front chair,  the idea is to have it attached all the trip, use it or not,  opening the table or not, but if you are not using it you cant close it complete, and any pencil or things inside start to fall in the floor because the zipper goes all over around the case, should be having double zipper starting from the ends and you can close it from the sides.

  Love these throws. Bought 2. One in purple and one grey. They are sooooo soft. Haven\^t washed then yet but I\^m sure they will hold up well. Looking at purchasing another one. One I use for my couch to cuddle up in and they other for the end of my bed.

  I use this for my cat so my duvet cover doesn\^t get all full of fur. It\^s perfect. I use it \^inside out\^ or on the reverse side cause I prefer the lighter colour and floofier appearance, but both sides are soft and lovely.

  I love everything about these pillow covers! They are exactly as claimed in the advertising! Very nicely made with nice invisible zippers. They have been professionally sewn with obvious care As I am a seamstress myself, but just didn\^t have the time to travel to get supplies, it was very convenient just to order them. The only thing I can see that wasn\^t done was matching the checks with the reverse side but for the money I wasn\^t expecting that to happen. I have some down pillow inserts that I bought that I now just buy pillow covers for. I don\^t have a lot of space to store decorator pillows with no zippers!

  I really like it, especially after it was installed. The material feels thick and do not look cheap. It fits very well, my son enjoys the animal prints, and the organizer pockets are in decent sizes. Haven’t had the need to clean it yet; but since it’s fabric, I am expecting it will be a bit harder to clean than the leather/plastic ones.

  Great buy, looks like it would be cheap, but it’s actually a great product! I have a tan interior vehicle so it goes great! Love the boyish theme, tons of space for wipes, diapers, pacifiers, bottles, toys, spare shoes, books, etc. I keep everything in this thing! It’s great! It’s more for me right now lol since my son is still rear-facing. Makes life SO much easier in the car - just reach back, grab what I need and hand it to him. No more pulling over or having to repeat “okay wait mommy’s almost there” - it’s a life saver. There’s adjustable buckles that go around the seat - lots of Lea way room to get that perfect fit. The stitching is sturdy, the cup holder I believe is actually insulated, there’s expanding netting at the bottom which is very handy!! A clear pouch - it won’t find the iPad if you have a protected cover on it. Which I do so I won’t be able to use that - I keep diapers in it for now lol shipping was fast, packaging was decent - no more/no less than what was needed.

  This is the second tablecloth I’ve purchased from this company. I am honestly surprised to see such positive reviews. I’m guessing the reviews are being written when the product first arrives. The first one I bought had only a small overhang and it shrunk a lot on the first wash (machine wash, air dry, as instructed) and it was smaller than my table after only the first wash. I thought ok maybe my bad, note to self, it shrinks after first wash so I purchased this one that is substantially bigger than my table. After the second wash, again, washed as instructed, it’s too small for my table. It’s unfortunate because it comes just as pictured and it’s a nice material and very beautiful. But to call it “shrink proof” is a straight up lie. If you plan to have this on a table that it’s less likely to get stains on it, maybe a good buy. But for the cost, if you’re putting it on your dinner table, you’re wasting your money.

  Because I do not have a lot of makeup, this case has ample room and provides the storage I need for the quantity of makeup I have. I have never used it for travelling purposes, as I would personally find it a bit large for my own needs, but it sits on my dresser and stores my everyday makeup items wonderfully. The section for the brushes is an adequate height, and it\^s easy to clean if you get powder on them because of the plastic material. I like how you can customize the configuration of the bottom section to suit your needs. I like using the zipper compartment to store small eye shadow palettes. If you pile it with too much stuff though, it may be difficult to close. Other than that, it\^s a really great makeup case.

  This harness does not prevent pulling at all. It just all moves to the side of the dog. It does work a little better if the leash is going through the legs, underneath the dog and that really should be stated somewhere. To keep harness from moving to the side so much, I had to make it way tighter than is comfortable for my dog. It’s then very hard to get the his head through the opening to take it off.

  I bought this, along with another harness from another brand on Amazon, just so I can have options. And I must say, this one was better by a mile. It\^s more sturdy and comfortable. My dog is much happier with this than the other. The other sits oddly underneath her armpits. I measured so the size is correct. With this harness, it fits perfectly around the chest and neck. It\^s much more cushiony and easier to adjust. I would highly recommend this product. Will buy again in the near future in different colours.

  This is the second tablecloth I’ve purchased from this company. I am honestly surprised to see such positive reviews. I’m guessing the reviews are being written when the product first arrives. The first one I bought had only a small overhang and it shrunk a lot on the first wash (machine wash, air dry, as instructed) and it was smaller than my table after only the first wash. I thought ok maybe my bad, note to self, it shrinks after first wash so I purchased this one that is substantially bigger than my table. After the second wash, again, washed as instructed, it’s too small for my table. It’s unfortunate because it comes just as pictured and it’s a nice material and very beautiful. But to call it “shrink proof” is a straight up lie. If you plan to have this on a table that it’s less likely to get stains on it, maybe a good buy. But for the cost, if you’re putting it on your dinner table, you’re wasting your money.

  I love the feel of these cushion covers―they are soft, velvety, and appear to be durable. However, I unfortunately had to return the items because they were a couple of inches too large for my current cushions. Furthermore, they are not a matte colour as I expected; they are a little shiny, which I didn’t like.

  I\^m redecorating my living room and have a deep love for throw pillows. I went to H&M, Winner\^s, and all the other big boiz to find some cushion covers. Yet, there I stood, with a single cushion cover in hand for a staggering $39.99, though right next to me was a completed cushion for 24.99. Why was I about to pay more for just a sad, empty shell (much like myself)? The craftsmaship was shoddy for the price, so I decided to test out \^ol faithful (Amazon). Enter these 2 velvety baddies. 2 for approximately $9 a pop! Soft as hell, fit my inserts perfectly, and overall just solid as hell.

  This is the second tablecloth I’ve purchased from this company. I am honestly surprised to see such positive reviews. I’m guessing the reviews are being written when the product first arrives. The first one I bought had only a small overhang and it shrunk a lot on the first wash (machine wash, air dry, as instructed) and it was smaller than my table after only the first wash. I thought ok maybe my bad, note to self, it shrinks after first wash so I purchased this one that is substantially bigger than my table. After the second wash, again, washed as instructed, it’s too small for my table. It’s unfortunate because it comes just as pictured and it’s a nice material and very beautiful. But to call it “shrink proof” is a straight up lie. If you plan to have this on a table that it’s less likely to get stains on it, maybe a good buy. But for the cost, if you’re putting it on your dinner table, you’re wasting your money.

  I have purchased 2 of these laptop stands and both came in great condition. Very durable and reliable, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with the appropriate laptop size. I use it for my HP Spectre x360 and the laptop fits flush with the groves of the stand which hold the laptop in place. Ideally, it\^s designed for thin laptops but I also use it for a Lenovo t430 and it fits quite well. It is a good design, it has two openings that run down both sides of the stand to allow for cables to run through.

  This harness does not prevent pulling at all. It just all moves to the side of the dog. It does work a little better if the leash is going through the legs, underneath the dog and that really should be stated somewhere. To keep harness from moving to the side so much, I had to make it way tighter than is comfortable for my dog. It’s then very hard to get the his head through the opening to take it off. I’m not sure how likely he is to outgrow this but I might be looking for a replacement anyway

  I bought this, along with another harness from another brand on Amazon, just so I can have options. And I must say, this one was better by a mile. It\^s more sturdy and comfortable. My dog is much happier with this than the other. The other sits oddly underneath her armpits. I measured so the size is correct. With this harness, it fits perfectly around the chest and neck. It\^s much more cushiony and easier to adjust. I would highly recommend this product. Will buy again in the near future in different colours.

Yet, there I stood, with a single cushion cover in hand for a staggering $39.99, though right next to me was a completed cushion for 24.99. Why was I about to pay more for just a sad, empty shell (much like myself)? The craftsmaship was shoddy for the price, so I decided to test out \^ol faithful (Amazon). Enter these 2 velvety baddies. 2 for approximately $9 a pop! Soft as hell, fit my inserts perfectly, and overall just solid as hell.

  This harness seems to fit well, is nicely padded and easily adjustable. The reflector trim is helpful as well since we walk along some busier streets. The top handle is good if you need to keep your dog from bolting at the sight of another dog, or rabbit, or skunk. Our labrador can really pull and this harness had yet to come off over her head [she pulls backward too] so we are satisfied with our purchase.

  This harness does not prevent pulling at all. It just all moves to the side of the dog. It does work a little better if the leash is going through the legs, underneath the dog and that really should be stated somewhere. To keep harness from moving to the side so much, I had to make it way tighter than is comfortable for my dog. It’s then very hard to get the his head through the opening to take it off. I’m not sure how likely he is to outgrow this but I might be looking for a replacement anyway

  I ordered this because I had tried a few from our local pet store none of them stopped the dog from pulling and me with it. I figured because of the way it\^s designed I would try it.  Wow what a difference. I have total control over him and he isn\^t bothered by it. We have pleasant walks now not the dread I felt before.

  I bought this, along with another harness from another brand on Amazon, just so I can have options. And I must say, this one was better by a mile. It\^s more sturdy and comfortable. My dog is much happier with this than the other. The other sits oddly underneath her armpits. I measured so the size is correct. With this harness, it fits perfectly around the chest and neck. It\^s much more cushiony and easier to adjust. I would highly recommend this product. Will buy again in the near future in different colours.

  Great teething mitts. My LO doesn’t like wearing them and instead prefers to hold them and chew. I love that they’re easy to clean and that you get 2 in the pack. I also like that they’re different colours so you can easily differentiate which one is in use and rotate easily. My LO loves thé crinkly sounds they make Too. You can’t go wrong for the price.

  If you have a Terex lover in your family, this is an awesome cuddle toy for them.  The dinosaur is very well made, so very soft just like velvet, stuffed to be firm but not hard. It comes in various colours so your child can have their own choice.  The child that found this under the tree Christmas Day fell in love with it right away and commented on how soft it was.  Delivery was in good time and a good choice over all. I was surprised  at the quality for the price.  If another dinosaur shows up in our family I will be purchasing this in their colour for sure.

  Very pleased and would highly recommend.  The colour is gorgeous and the quality seems pretty great.  Size is accurate as well.  The last set I bought from another seller was not accurate at all with the size (was actually 17x17 and not 18x18 as they advertised).  Made for a very tight fit.  These, however, are perfect.  Would not hesitate to purchase again.

  I love the feel of these cushion covers―they are soft, velvety, and appear to be durable. However, I unfortunately had to return the items because they were a couple of inches too large for my current cushions. Furthermore, they are not a matte colour as I expected; they are a little shiny, which I didn’t like. For me, this renders the product itself 4/5 stars, as while they appear to be durable and they do indeed feel nice, they aren\^t what I expected based on the photos.', '', '2021-04-25 14:28:26'), ('R3KU5OD81KWR0M','CA', 'B07NL5J3FD', 'Danielle ', '5.0', 'Incredible Value','Reviewed in Canada on March 31, 2019','29', '
  I\^m redecorating my living room and have a deep love for throw pillows. I went to H&M, Winner\^s, and all the other big boiz to find some cushion covers. Yet, there I stood, with a single cushion cover in hand for a staggering $39.99, though right next to me was a completed cushion for 24.99. Why was I about to pay more for just a sad, empty shell (much like myself)? The craftsmaship was shoddy for the price, so I decided to test out \^ol faithful (Amazon). Enter these 2 velvety baddies. 2 for approximately $9 a pop! Soft as hell, fit my inserts perfectly, and overall just solid as hell. My living room is now one step closer to being a velvet draped doom cave.

  Adorable design and fabrics. The quality is there for sure in these burp blankets.

  Overall I’m pleased with this product. The cloths are quite absorbent and contain spit up and drool well. Cute prints too! I removed one star as they seem a tad smaller than the stated measurements and the packaging they came in was minimalist to the extreme. They were shipped in a plastic bag with no product label or care tags or any store information whatsoever which I found a bit odd. I recommended machine washing and tumble drying on low for maintenance. Still a good product though. I would repurchase.

  Love these pillow cases. They are super soft to the touch and they add an awesome brightness to our living room. We have a black couch so they really pop and it’s amazing. A little bit stringy on the inside but that doesn’t bother me cause you don’t see it and the zipper is super sturdy

  \xa0I\^ve had this for a few months now and it does it\^s job, but ruins your screen protector. The protector on my ipad is on straight and no bubbles without the case. The bubbles go away if I press down, but it just keeps lifting the protector whenever the case kinda shifts. It\^s super annoying and I\^ll be purchasing a new case.

  Bought this jacket for my 7 year old grandson. He is 3’11” tall and 46 lbs. Size medium fit well with room for comfort and may still fit him next summer. I wanted a comfortable jacket for kayaking, tubing and water skiing. This was perfect- looks cool, he loves the colours, and the material, whistle handy if needed and he can maneuver well in the jacket. He is a little annoyed with the crotch strap but is wider and has two buckles on either side to keep in place and be more comfortable. We found the right amount of tension on the straps to fit right and no pulling. The jacket also did not ride up around his neck and chin when seated or swimming which was a plus too. All in all, a successful purchase.

  My own fault for buying this quickly and not noticing the word Kindle in the title. I\^d bought a Fire tablet and wanted a cover for it. I have a rose-pink laptop and thought this would make an attractive matching pair on my desk. However, the cover is too small for the tablet, so I had to give it to a family member who has a Kindle (which I can\^t use because e-readers make me instantly seasick and give me a migraine headache). Still looking for a cover for the tablet, but will take more care when reading the listing.

  I initially bought the pink one for my last daughter. My husband loved it so much he asked me to place an order for another one, for our second daughter because, I can say for sure, it’s very durable. Easy to fix the device in securely. I have no complaints at all. It’s practical and I’m sure it will last a very long time with the device safely tucked away. Worth every penny.

  Because I do not have a lot of makeup, this case has ample room and provides the storage I need for the quantity of makeup I have. I have never used it for travelling purposes, as I would personally find it a bit large for my own needs, but it sits on my dresser and stores my everyday makeup items wonderfully. The section for the brushes is an adequate height, and it\^s easy to clean if you get powder on them because of the plastic material. I like how you can customize the configuration of the bottom section to suit your needs. I like using the zipper compartment to store small eye shadow palettes. If you pile it with too much stuff though, it may be difficult to close. Other than that, it\^s a really great makeup case.

  This is perfect for the amount of makeup I have and organizing everything so easily. Before I just had everything in a small make up bag and had to sift through when I was looking for something, and I had things in drawers etc. Now everything can be in 1 place. I wouldn’t use it for travel - it is pretty large - unless I was travelling for more than a week or something. It’s perfect for sitting on my vanity though (and looks great too!)

  Bought this jacket for my 7 year old grandson. He is 3’11” tall and 46 lbs. Size medium fit well with room for comfort and may still fit him next summer. I wanted a comfortable jacket for kayaking, tubing and water skiing. This was perfect- looks cool, he loves the colours, and the material, whistle handy if needed and he can maneuver well in the jacket. He is a little annoyed with the crotch strap but is wider and has two buckles on either side to keep in place and be more comfortable. We found the right amount of tension on the straps to fit right and no pulling. The jacket also did not ride up around his neck and chin when seated or swimming which was a plus too. All in all, a successful purchase.

  My own fault for buying this quickly and not noticing the word Kindle in the title. I\^d bought a Fire tablet and wanted a cover for it. I have a rose-pink laptop and thought this would make an attractive matching pair on my desk. However, the cover is too small for the tablet, so I had to give it to a family member who has a Kindle (which I can\^t use because e-readers make me instantly seasick and give me a migraine headache). Still looking for a cover for the tablet, but will take more care when reading the listing.

  I purchased this set for my niece after she indicated she really wanted an art set for her 7th birthday. Well, it turns out that I wasn\^t the only person she told this too. The first gift she opened was a lovely metal case with pencils, crayons and other expected tools. I was concerned until she opened the Zooawa kit. She lost her mind and so did the child that gave her the other set. In fact, the Mum that purchased the other set asked me where I got this and she immediately looked it up for future purchase. Once all the gifts were opened, this was the one that my niece and her friends wanted to play with. Very satisfying for this Auntie!

The last set I bought from another seller was not accurate at all with the size (was actually 17x17 and not 18x18 as they advertised).  Made for a very tight fit.  These, however, are perfect.  Would not hesitate to purchase again.

  I love the feel of these cushion covers―they are soft, velvety, and appear to be durable. However, I unfortunately had to return the items because they were a couple of inches too large for my current cushions. Furthermore, they are not a matte colour as I expected; they are a little shiny, which I didn’t like.

  I\^m redecorating my living room and have a deep love for throw pillows. I went to H&M, Winner\^s, and all the other big boiz to find some cushion covers. Yet, there I stood, with a single cushion cover in hand for a staggering $39.99, though right next to me was a completed cushion for 24.99. Why was I about to pay more for just a sad, empty shell (much like myself)? The craftsmaship was shoddy for the price, so I decided to test out \^ol faithful (Amazon). Enter these 2 velvety baddies. 2 for approximately $9 a pop! Soft as hell, fit my inserts perfectly, and overall just solid as hell. My living room is now one step closer to being a velvet draped doom cave.

  Good product for the price. Only issue is how strong the suction effect is.  My kids have a red mark on their faces when using it for long.  I adjusted on one child 5-6 times to find the best hold with least pressure. It helped a lot but the mark was still present after our swim. My kids do enjoy them, they look bright and happy. I recommend this product for a single child and not to be shared because of the specific adjustments required.

  Poorly designed. In order for it to fit nicely over your eyes the strap needs to go over your ears, which is uncomfortable. If the strap is above your ears the sleep mask is mostly sitting on top of your eyebrows, not fitting properly over your eyes. I gave it a 3 because I could see how it would be acceptable to someone else and it is soft fabric.

  This is a soft and ptetty maak, good quality fabric and construction, and probably good for occasional use. However as a daily eye mask user, I have a couple of quibbles. While this mask does not leak light around the edges, it is not a total black out mask. I can see a faint glow through the fabric even when my eyes are closed. This will matter to you if you are day sleeper. My other quibble is with the elastic strap that holds the mask on. While it is adjustable, the elastic tends to fold over and cut into my head. The elastic also knots my hair, and the plastic part for adjusting length gets tangled in my hair and pulls on it. I recommend getting one with a fabric covered elastic of this masters to you.

  I purchased this for my Kindle 8th. It looked decent from the picture but the actual product is really nice.  All details - features, stitches - and the feel of the material inside and outside is so amazing.  And it is super light and does not add any extra weight, which I love - especially when holding it in bed.  I also have Kindle Paperwhite and will look if this cover is also available for Paperwhite.  The design is so smart and the denim-like texture is beautiful. *Those who say their Kindle does not fit, I am sure they did not know pretty much all Kindles come in different size and that we need to make sure the case is made for the specific Kindle model + generation.

  Love the look of this mask. Unfortunately, I need to adjust the strap to a loose setting so it’s not too tight around my eyes. However, this also makes the mask slip off during the night. I wish the straps were made in a Y shape so that it wasn’t so tight in the center of the mask, and put less pressure on the eyes.

  Poorly designed. In order for it to fit nicely over your eyes the strap needs to go over your ears, which is uncomfortable. If the strap is above your ears the sleep mask is mostly sitting on top of your eyebrows, not fitting properly over your eyes. I gave it a 3 because I could see how it would be acceptable to someone else and it is soft fabric.

  This is a soft and ptetty maak, good quality fabric and construction, and probably good for occasional use. However as a daily eye mask user, I have a couple of quibbles. While this mask does not leak light around the edges, it is not a total black out mask. I can see a faint glow through the fabric even when my eyes are closed. This will matter to you if you are day sleeper. My other quibble is with the elastic strap that holds the mask on. While it is adjustable, the elastic tends to fold over and cut into my head. The elastic also knots my hair, and the plastic part for adjusting length gets tangled in my hair and pulls on it. I recommend getting one with a fabric covered elastic of this masters to you.

  I purchased this for my Kindle 8th. It looked decent from the picture but the actual product is really nice.  All details - features, stitches - and the feel of the material inside and outside is so amazing.  And it is super light and does not add any extra weight, which I love - especially when holding it in bed.  I also have Kindle Paperwhite and will look if this cover is also available for Paperwhite.  The design is so smart and the denim-like texture is beautiful. *Those who say their Kindle does not fit, I am sure they did not know pretty much all Kindles come in different size and that we need to make sure the case is made for the specific Kindle model + generation.

  I purchased this for my Kindle 8th. It looked decent from the picture but the actual product is really nice.  All details - features, stitches - and the feel of the material inside and outside is so amazing.  And it is super light and does not add any extra weight, which I love - especially when holding it in bed.  I also have Kindle Paperwhite and will look if this cover is also available for Paperwhite.  The design is so smart and the denim-like texture is beautiful. *Those who say their Kindle does not fit, I am sure they did not know pretty much all Kindles come in different size and that we need to make sure the case is made for the specific Kindle model + generation.

  This looked like a good product but had to return it as the tablet would just pop out if you moved the case a bit.  The "clips" that should hold the table securely in place were either not strong enough or perhaps it\^s that the clips don\^t actually clip to the front of the tablet.  Tablet we have is the Samsung Tab A 10.1 - 2019 edition and it would just slide right out eventhough the tablet fit perfectly in the case.

  The case is nice, and seems well built. It fits snug on the tablet and holds the tablet in the different modes like it states. Where it advertises that the cover opening and closing wakes up and sleeps the tablet is a total lie though. It doesn\^t do that at all. If the screen is on or playing something and you close the cover, it does nothing. The screen stays on and playing. I won\^t return it though since it was only $10 and I didn\^t really buy it for that reason anyway. But it\^s blatant false advertising, so only 3 stars for that.

  Very disappointed in the fake information in the item listing.  I saw the reviews for the 2 compartment saying it was too small, but didn\^t see any for the 4 compartment, and since the seller has a photo showing the physical dimensions I thought I would be safe. Nope, total lie. Actual height is 3.75, as shown in my photo, and that doesn\^t account for the  dip from where the lid sits inside. Also no marbling on the outside at all, so aesthetically it is not nice either.  Do not purchase if you need something that is deeper than 3.5 inches or your lid will not fit.

  Possibly the best purchase of 2021. My dog is a short haired white bully who loves to sunbathe; however, this has led to some sunburns on his nose and around his eyes. This hat is not only unforgivingly adorable, it’s super practical, and keeps him cool. He has a very large head, so I was worried about the fit, but the XL is perfect. The best part - it came with a matching hat for me!
